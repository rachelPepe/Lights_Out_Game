# Lights_Out_Game

I created this game to practice basic javaScript. This Lights Out game has a grid of 3x3 or 5x5 squares, with each square representing a light on or off. 

The goal of the game is to turn off all the lights by clicking on the squares.

Each click toggles the light that is in the clicked square along with each perpendicularly adjacent square. Each square has 4 adjacent squares toggled with it: top, bottom, right, and left. 

The game begins with one or more lights on and is won when all lights are toggled off.
